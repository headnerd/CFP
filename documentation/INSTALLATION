Simple installation
===================

- git clone
- run "php bin/vendors install" to install all 3rd party bundles (and symfony itself)
- run "php app/console doctrine:schema:create"
- Create initial user via "php app/console fos:user:create"
- There is no example database yet, so you have to create your own :(
