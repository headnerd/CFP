Submitting to a conference CfP
==============================
- Can only take place when the CfP is open for the conference
- User registers a biography and other info to the conference
- User selects a talk to submit -> talk submission
- User add additional information if needed (remarks etc)
- Talk can be edited or retracted while CfP is open. Does not change the actual "talk" template used
- User should be able to see all submissions ever done, plus statistics on acceptance / rejections etc


Conferences
===========

- Multiple users can become conference host
- Conference must be accepted by admins (?)
- When CfP is open, users will be allowed to add talks
- Conference hosts are allowed to view bio's and talks (but only the ones that are submitted!)

Problems
========
When we have a multi-host talk, and one of the users submits a talk to a conference, what do we show when a
conference host will look at the talk? Does it see all the users? But which bio's?
