Todo:
=====
[X] User should be able to register and login/logout
[X] User should be able to view all his talks submitted
[X] Everyone should be able view all conferences (sorted by latest, open cfp etc)
[X] Let user create multiple biographies (php biography, linux biography etc)
[X] Let user add / update talks
        X multiple type of talks (workshops, talk, estimated time)
        X links to joind.in / slideshare / etc
[ ] Let user create conference
[ ] Let user add other users as "conference host"
[-] Let user add talks to conferences
        - (only during cfp opening)
[ ] Send email to user that talk was submitted
[ ] Let "conference hosts" vote for talks (cfp-vote-entity)
[X] User should be able to view all talks submitted to conferences
[ ] Add ability for user to add multiple speakers to talk (by email-address?)
[ ] Make sure resources are secured by acl/authorization
    - Talks & bios can only be edited by owner
    - Talks & bios can only be viewed by owner or conference hosts
[ ] When we use our security context, make sure when it's expired (ie: string("anon.")), things don't break.
[X] Update layout HTML of cfp
[ ] When CFP is not open, we should not be allowed to add CFP. Also we should not add the Add CFP links?
[ ] When we already posted a CFP, we cannot post a new one, use the existing one


Bugs & issues:
==============
[ ] Use generic way of CRUD:
        X Every route in separate Resources/config/routing/*.yml
        - CRUD has separate edit/update new/create actions
        - showall.html.twig should be index.html.twig
        - form.html.twig should be edit.html.twig
[ ] Fix inline @TODO's
[ ] Does not update uploaded biography pictures


Low prio:
=========
[ ] Add option to create a public voting (one up/down vote per user per talk)
[ ] Let public comment on public cfp's (like on confoo12)
[ ] Have the option that public votes are done without knowing the speaker (just title+abstract)
[ ] Let conference hosts export cfp information on CSV or other format
[ ] Let user subscribe for reminders when call-for-papers are opened
[ ] /my/talks: Add number of times a talk is submitted to a conference
