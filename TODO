Todo:
[X] User should be able to register and login/logout
[ ] User should be able to view all his talks submitted
[X] Everyone should be able view all conferences (sorted by latest, open cfp etc)
[X] Let user create multiple biographies (php biography, linux biography etc)
[X] Let user add / update talks
        X multiple type of talks (workshops, talk, estimated time)
        X links to joind.in / slideshare / etc
[ ] Let user create conference
[ ] Let user add other users as "conference host"
[ ] Let user add talks to conferences (only during cfp opening)
[ ] Send email to user that talk was submitted
[ ] Let "conference hosts" vote for talks
[ ] User should be able to view all talks submitted to conferences
[ ] Add ability for user to add multiple speakers to talk (by email-address?)

[ ] Use generic way of CRUD:
        X Every route in separate Resources/config/routing/*.yml
        - CRUD has separate edit/update new/create actions
        - showall.html.twig should be index.html.twig
        - form.html.twig should be edit.html.twig

Low prio:
[ ] Add option to create a public voting (one up/down vote per user per talk)
[ ] Let public comment on public cfp's (like on confoo12)
[ ] Have the option that public votes are done without knowing the speaker (just title+abstract)
[ ] Let conference hosts export cfp information on CSV or other format
[ ] Let user subscribe for reminders when call-for-papers are opened
